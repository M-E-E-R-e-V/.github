# M.E.E.R. e.V.



## The association
The purpose of the association is to promote environmental protection, science and education, especially the protection of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) and their marine habitat, as well as the study of cetaceans off La Gomera (Canary Islands).

#### `M`AMMALS
The waters off the island of La Gomera are home to a special biodiversity of dolphins and whales, with over 20 species.

#### `E`NCOUNTERS
Watching dolphins and whales in their natural habitat is one of the most impressive experiences of nature. We set an example of how to make it ecologically sustainable.

#### `E`DUCATION
We provide comprehensive information – e.g. with lectures, events, seminars, internship courses, and our permanent exhibition on La Gomera and this website.

#### `R`ESEARCH
Our research is for the conservation of dolphins and whales and their habitat – sighting data, behavioural observations, photo-identification, land-based observations, interdisciplinary studies and more.

## Activities
M.E.E.R. e.V. is an organization primarily concerned with research on the whales and dolphins off La Gomera.

However, it is equally important to us to present the results of our research in an understandable way, as well as to foster the direct connection of humans and the sea, and marine conservation. This is accomplished through the following activities.
